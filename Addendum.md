There is a H/W and S/W modification to this project that adds an auto detected high temperature
K Type Thermocouple probe sensor whose value then replaces any (default) displayed DS1820 sensor readings.
This modification greatly extends the units capabilities into the high temperature regime for use
in ovens, kilns, etc.

This mod is currently running on the authors prototype but specific details have not yet been posted.

Note that the mod will consist of a new software upload (backward compatable to the original design)
and details on addong a small daughter board/panel connector to the UNO board/case to interface the thermocouple.

In the interim, interested parties can contact the author for details (glennt@palmnet.net)
